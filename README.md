We have developed a small carpooling application using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js). 
This app allows users to create and find carpooling opportunities.
It's a simple yet functional platform that demonstrates the capabilities of the MEAN stack in building dynamic web applications.
